Good, solid wordpress hosting is something that seems to be becoming more elusive.

For many years I used to used Tsohost as they were cheap and amazingly ran deals that cost only Â£10 a year.

As my website portfolio grew it was easy to scale at this price point, but as time went on Tsohost's service and quality diminished and they went from a very good company to one that was fraught with downtime, rude customer service and so on.

What then was the alternative?  Turning to SEO Twitter there are lots of options and one of the classic alternatives was WP Engine.

There is in my opinion a better alternative though and that is WPX.

I took the plunge to migrate one of my Amazon affiliate sites over to WPX and the service was fantastic.  At every stage they helped me along the way providing a free migration and removal of malware from my installation.

If you are staying with a hosting provider because you have always been with them I would say definitely look into WPX as an alternative as their service is fantastic and the performance metrics speak for themselves.
